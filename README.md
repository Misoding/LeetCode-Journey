# Algorithm Design and Complexity Analysis

This repository contains formal solutions and rigorous complexity analysis for algorithmic problems sourced primarily from **LeetCode**.

The objective is to provide a comprehensive engineering approach to these challenges, prioritizing theoretical correctness, asymptotic behavior, and formal optimization techniques over simple implementation.

## Repository Structure

Each entry corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem and is organized to include:
1.  **Source Code:** Optimized implementation (C++, Java, or Python).
2.  **Documentation:** A technical report covering:
    * Problem constraints and edge case analysis.
    * Algorithmic paradigm selection (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, Sliding Window).
    * Formal time and space complexity derivation using Big O notation.
    * Mathematical proof of correctness (where applicable).

## Methodology

The analysis follows standard academic rigor:
* **Correctness:** Verification via loop invariants or inductive reasoning.
* **Asymptotic Analysis:** Evaluation of Worst-Case, Average-Case, and Best-Case scenarios relative to input size constraints.
* **Recurrence Relations:** Derivation and solving of recurrences for recursive solutions.

## Attribution and Tools

The algorithmic logic, mathematical proofs, and source code implementations are original work.

Generative AI tools were utilized strictly for:
* LaTeX and Markdown formatting.
* Syntactical structuring of the documentation.
